Mainly inspired by the desktop application found at:
https://outfoxeed.itch.io/rock-paper-scissors-simulation

I wanted to make this a completely browser based experience as I see that as the most accesible form of content to consume.

I also wanted to add more freedom to the user in terms of setting up some sort of strategy with **how many** rock/paper/scissors images can be added, on top of **where** they can be added.

These two things should allow for the user to have a similar experience to what was displayed in the desktop application.

Currently unsolved problems:
* Make UI easier to work with and add instructions
* Make it so the images don't get squished every time the window is resized
* Make objects both run away from the nearest enemy, and move towards the closest objective

Possibly fun future features:
* Add a login system so that user's can save certain canvas/play area setups for later tinkering.
* Add the ability to make the canvas larger or smaller for a wider play area.
* Add a slider or option to change the speed of the game.
* Add the ability to create obstacles objects would have to move around.
